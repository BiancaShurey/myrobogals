<h2>2017-01-01: New Year, New myRobogals!</h2>
<p>We have recently done a much needed upgrade of myRobogals. This means that it will now be easier to maintain and build upon in the future. However, with the upgrade, there will be some pages that will be broken as a result. So we will need your help to report any broken links and bugs to  <a href="mailto:support@robogals.org">support@robogals.org</a>, and we will have them fixed as quickly as we can.
