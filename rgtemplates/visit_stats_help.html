<span style="text-decoration: underline">Robogals workshop, metro area</span><br>
Robogals ran an engineering-related workshop where we visited the school, or the school visited us at uni, and Robogals was the <em>causa sine qua non</em> (the cause without which it would not have happened) for this workshop to have happened.<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Robogals workshop, regional area</span><br>
Same as above, but in a rural or regional area.<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Non-Robogals workshop</span><br>
Robogals volunteers assisted with another program similar to our workshops, or ran a workshop which was mostly instigated by another event/organisation (give details).<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Robogals career talk</span><br>
Robogals volunteers visited a school, or the school visited us, for a talk about engineering or STEM careers, with no hands-on activities.<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Robogals event</span><br>
An event run by your chapter, e.g. a science fair.<br>
<br>
<span style="text-decoration: underline">Non-Robogals career talk / event</span><br>
Robogals volunteers assisted with another program related to Robogals' broad aims (give details).<br>
<br>
<br>
At the crux of the distinction between "Robogals" and "Non-Robogals" is whether the bulk of effort and initiative that went into making it happen came from Robogals or another organisation.  This is to ensure that we are comparing apples with apples when comparing stats between chapters.<br>
